# Roborally

## About The Project
This is a digitized version of Avalon Hill‚Äôs board game, called ‚ÄúRoborally‚Äù.
Roborally is to be played by 2-6 players, and possesses many of the mechanics from the original Roborally game, such as lasers, upgrades, board elements as well as many others. 
In addition this digital version implements additional databasesupport for saving and loading games.

### Built with
- Java
- MariaDB/MySQL
- Json
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)
- [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)
- [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)
- [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)

## How to play
### Rules
[Rules](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rules/roborally_rules.pdf)

Each turn, you‚Äôll draw random
Program cards, each featuring an instruction for the movement of your robot. Choose
five of those cards to plan out your robot‚Äôs moves across a perilous course with the goal of being
the first to touch all the checkpoints in order.
 Getting to the checkpoints isn‚Äôt always easy, though, because you‚Äôll execute your moves at
the same time as all the other players. Robots will get in each other‚Äôs way, push each other off
course, and shoot each other with lasers. Sometimes the biggest challenge is just surviving!

The order of each turn:
 1. Get programming cards (automatic)
 2. Arrange your Program cards among your
 five registers. (users)
 3. Complete each register in order: execute the Program
 cards, complete board movements, resolve all
 interactions, and touch flags and repair sites. (user)
 Repeat
