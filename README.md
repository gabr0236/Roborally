## How to play
[Rules](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rules/roborally_rules.pdf)

Each turn, you’ll draw random
Program cards, each featuring an instruction for the movement of your robot. Choose
five of those cards to plan out your robot’s moves across a perilous course with the goal of being
the first to touch all the checkpoints in order.
 Getting to the checkpoints isn’t always easy, though, because you’ll execute your moves at
the same time as all the other players. Robots will get in each other’s way, push each other off
course, and shoot each other with lasers. Sometimes the biggest challenge is just surviving!

The order of each turn
 1. Get programming cards (automatic)
 2. Arrange your Program cards among your
 five registers. (users)
 3. Complete each register in order: execute the Program
 cards, complete board movements, resolve all
 interactions, and touch flags and repair sites. (user)
 Repeat

Board elements:

📡: Determines the order of which the robots moves are made by closest first.
🟩: Spawnpoint.
🟩 ▶️: Conveyor belt, moves robot 1 square in a direction.
🟦 ▶️: Conveyor belt, moves robot 2 squares in a direction.
▶️: player.
| 🟨: Push panel, pushes any player standing on the field on the registers described on the board.
| 🟥: Wall.
⬛️: Pit, player dies if they step on it or over it.
